# Fire In The Salad Kingdom
General Unity Rules:

-NEVER Change a Scene Which you have pulled. If you want to edit it, make a copy and edit the copy
-Be careful when changing folders and locations, make sure you run 
    git status
 to check that the changes of location will not only add to the new location but remove from the previous
location
